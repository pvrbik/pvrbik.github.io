Paul,

Here are my LaTeX lecture notes.

PolyFun.tex and F-algebra.tex are input by CategoryTheory.tex.  I have not cleaned up CategoryTheory.tex yet, so it contains some junk we haven't covered.

I don't think I used fp.tex, but since it was in the directory with my other lecture notes (perhaps so I could copy some bits of it) I will include it on the theory that it is better to give you something you don't need than to exclude something that I used after all.

There are two PDF files that I do not have in another format.

I hope this stuff is useful.

Warren
